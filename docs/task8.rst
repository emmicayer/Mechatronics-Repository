Task 8: Track Run
====


TrackRun is a high level script that sections the game course into chunks to separate them into line following sections and state estimation sections. Shown below is the game track that Romi was tasked to navigate. This game track includes multiple sections that can be navigated purely with line following, a split path, checkpoints, a square wave section, a garage, and a wall to hit and navigate around. To complete this task, we section off the track into half line following sections and half state estimation sections.

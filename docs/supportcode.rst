Support Code Files
========

In our source files, we've also included some support files that were used to test and impliment our code throughout the process of this journey with Romi. These files are not necessary to run Romi, but are included to show our whole implimentation process. These files include PC script and the data csv file. 

Other support files used to impliment cooperative multitasking in Python are shown in a separate repository here: https://github.com/spluttflob/ME405-Support. These two files, cotask and taskshare, are written by the user spluttflob. Other support files, along with documentation for support mateiral, are shown in the user's repository. 

All four support files are attached below and can all be found in the Mechatronics Repository (along with all comprehensive code) as well.

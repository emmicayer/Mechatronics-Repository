PC Scrpit Support File
=====

PC Script reads CSV data from PuTTY logs and plots motor position and velocity verus time. This script loads a CSV file containing time, positon, and velocity measurements for 
left and right motors; parses and converts raw counts into physical units (radians and rad/ms); and rejects malformed or commented lines; creates and saves four plots: left position, left velocity, 
right position, and right velocity as functions of time. It is intended to run on a PC to visualize data collected from a microcontroller over a serial terminal.
